# IoT Surface Light-Dependant-Resistor
## Description

This project is a group effort / classroom project by Alina Simon, Max Flügel, and Jannes Bikker for the lecture: **Systems and Control Engineering - Technik und IoT**. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate the use of IoT devices in a practical application.

The task was to create an IoT device that measures and outputs the color of solid materials. Preferably surfaces. The timespan was around three weeks. 

## Usage

The IoT device can be accessed and used over the webinterface. But the Arduino device itself is required at all times.

## Webinterface

## Installing
In order to use the device you will need to make sure that the following requirements are fullfilled. 

### Prefabricated parts
